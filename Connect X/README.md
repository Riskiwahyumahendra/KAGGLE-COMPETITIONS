# Hello fellow Kagglers!

This notebook presents a **ConnectX agent built using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha Beta pruning**. The purpose of this explanation is to clarify the reasoning behind the implementation and to outline how each component contributes to the agent's decision making process.

Rather than focusing only on the final code, the discussion highlights the structural ideas that guide the solution. ConnectX provides a compact yet strategically rich environment where classical search algorithms can demonstrate strong performance when implemented carefully.

The sections below walk through the architecture of the agent and explain how the algorithm evaluates board states, explores future possibilities, and ultimately selects a move.


---

## Understanding the ConnectX Environment

ConnectX is a generalized version of Connect Four. Two players alternately drop pieces into vertical columns of a grid. Each piece falls to the lowest available position within the selected column.

A player wins when a sequence of pieces forms a continuous line. The alignment may be:

- horizontal  
- vertical  
- diagonal  

The Kaggle environment defines the board using three parameters:

- **rows**
- **columns**
- **inarow**

The `inarow` parameter determines how many consecutive pieces are required to win.

In the standard configuration used in most competitions:

- rows = 6  
- columns = 7  
- inarow = 4  

This results in a board containing **42 playable cells**.


---

## Board Representation

The board state is stored as a **one dimensional list** rather than a two dimensional matrix. This representation simplifies indexing and reduces computational overhead during repeated evaluations.

Each position corresponds to a cell using the mapping:

```
index = row * columns + column
```

For a 6 × 7 board the flattened structure appears as:

```
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6
 7  8  9 10 11 12 13
14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25 26 27
28 29 30 31 32 33 34
35 36 37 38 39 40 41
```

Each cell contains one of three values:

- `0` indicates an empty position  
- `1` indicates player one  
- `2` indicates player two  


---

## Determining Valid Moves

A move is valid if a column still contains available space.

The algorithm determines this by checking the **top cell of each column**. If the top cell is empty, the column can accept another piece. If it is occupied, the column is full.

This rule works because pieces always stack upward from the bottom of the board.


---

## Simulating Moves

During search the algorithm evaluates many hypothetical board states. Each candidate move is simulated by constructing a temporary board configuration.

The process follows four steps:

1. Create a copy of the current board  
2. Scan the chosen column from the bottom row upward  
3. Locate the first empty position  
4. Place the player's marker in that cell  

Using a copied board ensures that the original state remains unchanged while exploring alternative branches of the search tree.


---

## Detecting Winning Positions

Win detection determines whether a newly placed piece completes a winning alignment.

The algorithm evaluates four directional patterns from the landing position:

- horizontal  
- vertical  
- positive diagonal  
- negative diagonal  

For each direction, consecutive pieces belonging to the same player are counted in both directions. If the total count reaches the `inarow` requirement, the move results in a winning configuration.

This localized evaluation avoids unnecessary inspection of unrelated board regions.


---

## Heuristic Board Evaluation

When the search reaches its depth limit, the algorithm must estimate the quality of the board position. This estimation is performed by a **heuristic evaluation function**, which assigns a numerical score to the board.

The scoring reflects several strategic observations about ConnectX gameplay.


### Center Column Advantage

Positions near the center of the board participate in more potential winning alignments. For this reason the evaluation function assigns additional weight to pieces placed in the center column. Encouraging central control improves long term positional strength.


### Window Based Pattern Analysis

The board is scanned using sliding windows of length equal to `inarow`. In the standard game this corresponds to groups of four consecutive cells.

Each window is evaluated according to its composition. Examples include:

- four aligned pieces for the player  
- three pieces with one open space  
- two pieces with multiple opportunities  

For instance, a window containing **three aligned pieces and one empty cell** represents an immediate winning opportunity in the next move and therefore receives a strong positive score. Conversely, windows where the opponent is close to completing a sequence receive negative scores so the agent prioritizes blocking those threats.


---

## Minimax Search

The agent's decision making framework is based on **Minimax**, a classical algorithm used in adversarial games.

Minimax models two players with opposing objectives:

- the maximizing player attempts to achieve the highest possible score  
- the minimizing player attempts to reduce that score  

Each node in the search tree represents a potential board state. The evaluation produced at deeper nodes propagates upward through the recursion, allowing the maximizing player to select the move that leads to the strongest achievable outcome assuming optimal play from the opponent.


---

## Search Depth and Branching Complexity

The number of possible game states grows rapidly as moves are explored.

In ConnectX the branching factor can reach **seven possible moves per turn**, corresponding to the seven columns of the board.

Because each move can lead to several additional possibilities, the total number of evaluated states increases exponentially as search depth grows. Without pruning, even moderate depths would require evaluating thousands of board states.

To control this complexity, the algorithm limits the depth of the search. When the depth limit is reached, the heuristic evaluation function estimates the strength of the position.


---

## Alpha Beta Pruning

Alpha Beta pruning improves the efficiency of the Minimax search by eliminating branches that cannot influence the final decision.

Two bounds are maintained during exploration:

- **alpha** represents the best score the maximizing player can guarantee  
- **beta** represents the best score the minimizing player can guarantee  

If the search determines that a branch cannot improve the current outcome, that branch is abandoned early.

This optimization dramatically reduces the number of evaluated positions and enables deeper searches within practical computational limits.


---

## Move Ordering Strategy

The implementation evaluates candidate moves beginning with columns closest to the center of the board.

Central columns tend to produce stronger strategic opportunities in ConnectX. Evaluating promising moves earlier increases the likelihood that Alpha Beta pruning will eliminate weaker branches of the search tree.


---

## Agent Decision Flow

The final agent function follows the interface required by the Kaggle environment:

```
agent(observation, configuration)
```

For each move the agent performs the following steps:

1. Identify all valid columns  
2. Simulate each possible move  
3. Evaluate resulting positions using Minimax with Alpha Beta pruning  
4. Select the column that produces the strongest evaluation score  

All supporting functions are included within the agent definition so that the final submission remains fully self contained.


---

## Closing Remarks

ConnectX provides an excellent setting for exploring adversarial search algorithms. Even with simple rules, the interaction between search depth, heuristic evaluation, and pruning strategies creates a rich decision landscape.

The implementation in this notebook serves as a structural reference for experimenting with classical game search techniques. Adjusting evaluation weights, search depth, or move ordering strategies can reveal interesting variations in agent behavior and provide deeper insight into algorithmic decision making in competitive environments.

Discussion, experimentation, and alternative approaches are always welcome.
